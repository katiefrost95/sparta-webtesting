In this repo I am using the Selenium webdriver to practice and explore the page object model.

This repo includes an introduction to selenium and practice accessing elements and testing the http://demoqa.com/registration/ website.

Also includes practice using capybara. Used the capybara gem to carrie out tests of user experience on the bbc website.
